# AI Code Workflow

AI Code Workflow is a VS Code extension for browser-based AI coding assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and similar tools. It refreshes Repomix project context, builds one ready-to-send AI request file, collects optional screenshots or files, opens the selected AI chat, and then safely previews and applies the JSON operations returned by the model.

## Features

- **Create AI Request:** Write a task in VS Code and always refresh `repomix-output` before preparing a request.
- **Multi-Provider Handoff:** Open ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok.
- **Any File Assets:** Paste screenshots with `Ctrl+V` or add any local files; they are copied into the handoff package.
- **Bundled Instructions:** Uses the extension's built-in JSON operations instruction template in any project.
- **Repomix Scope Rules:** Add include/exclude file or folder rules before preparing context, so Repomix can scan only the relevant project areas.
- **Clean Handoff Folder:** Generates `ai-request.txt`, fresh Repomix output, and any added files in one folder for easy multi-file upload.
- **Temp Cleanup:** Removes old AI Code Workflow handoff and asset folders from the system temp directory.
- **Review & Apply Patch:** Paste the AI JSON response, format it, analyze operations, preview diffs, and apply safely.
- **Patch Payload Search:** Search inside the AI patch payload, see match counts, and jump between matches while reviewing JSON operations.
- **Safety Checks:** Blocks absolute paths, path traversal, `.git`, and `node_modules` edits before writing changes.

## How to Use

1. Open a workspace folder that is a Git repository.
2. Run **AI Code Workflow: Open** from the command palette.
3. In **Create AI Request**, write the task you want the AI model to perform.
4. Paste any useful screenshots into the request area with `Ctrl+V`.
5. Optionally add **Repomix scope rules** to include only specific files/folders or exclude noisy paths from the generated project context.
6. Pick an AI provider and click **Prepare AI Request**. Repomix is refreshed every time using the selected scope rules.
7. Paste the copied prompt into the AI chat and upload the files from the handoff folder together.
8. Paste the model's JSON response into **Review & Apply Patch**.
9. Use the search field if you need to find specific files, operations, or text inside the patch payload.
10. Use **Analyze**, **Preview**, and **Apply Patch** to inspect and write the patch.
